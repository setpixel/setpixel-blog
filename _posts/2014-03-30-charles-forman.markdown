My name is Charles and I've been making stuff my whole life. I'm more of a creative person than a technical one. However, I've been accused at being good at both.

What I do

Origin story

Resume / Timeline

<figure class="image-regular">
<pre>Charles Forman is a movie maker, dreamer, product designer, and entrepreneur. He founded OMGPOP, a video game company, that developed Draw Something, and ultimately sold to Zynga. He co-founded Picturelife which is pretty much awesome. He has lived in Chicago, Tokyo, Seoul, and New York City. Gawker has called him the most interesting new millionaire playboy in tech, although this is pretty much untrue. He currently lives in NYC and is working on developing a movie.</pre>

##About this blog

Statistically, about 4 times a year, I write a blog post about something I'm interested in. The posts tend to be long. I wish I wrote articles more often, and if there is something you'd like to read about, let me know.

Technically, this blog was made using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_new">Jekyll</a> and is hosted on Amazon S3, and Cloudfront. I deploy using the s3_website gem. After years of keeping blogs on Tumblr, I have happily made the switch, and Jekyll makes things super easy. 

I designed this blog with Bootstrap, but I ended up changing all the CSS. The focus on the blog is readability. The width of the text is fixed, allowing 8 to 10 words per line. Your eye can easily find the next line with 8 words per line. Additionally, hanging single words at the end of the paragraphs have been eliminated, as well as the first word of a sentence at the end of a line. This was done using Javascript.

I decided to have the text go purely down the center, and if space available, put non-essential content in the margins. On mobile, most of that content disappears.
