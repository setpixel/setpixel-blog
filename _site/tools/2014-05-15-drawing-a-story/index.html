<p>Most creative processes are iterative. </p>

<p>In video game development, you start with an idea of what you want to create. Development of the game starts on day 1. As the game is built, there idea starts to firm. You lose time playing your own game. As the game starts to firm up, you bring in outside people to give their feedback. Even though your original idea is pretty true to what you&#39;ve made, the controlled feedback from play testers is telling you that while promising, your game is just not fun.</p>

<p>But of course! They didn&#39;t understand a key thing that the game neglected to educate them about. I can just make some minor modifications and test again.</p>

<p>Sure enough, after some minor changes, a new group of testers think this is the best game in the world. This is done many times to ensure the most fun game possible.</p>

<p>Even after the game&#39;s release, we listen to mass market feedback to extract what we could do to make the game better. We are able to issue updates quickly.</p>

<p>In some rare cases, the thesis for a new game is very original, and even though I think the idea has a lot of potential, the only way to know is to build it. In every case, we rapidly prototype a working version of the game, and test it in the team, and outside testers. Sometimes, the result is not good. So not good that the entire idea for the game needs to be rethought. Perhaps there is some essence in the original idea that will still hold true, but it doesn&#39;t make sense to develop the game any longer.</p>

<p>Realizing this is bittersweet. It&#39;s not a good feeling trying something and knowing you failed, however, it&#39;s much better knowing that early. Besides, on the reimagination of the game, more of the essence of the original idea is there than you originally thought, it just wasn&#39;t clear at the time.    </p>

<p>In movie development, the story is developed in a relative vacuum. The story is validated by an extremely limited number of people. Due to production requiring many people involved with disconnect schedules, the actual production window is extremely short. It is also the most expensive.</p>

<p>If you, your producer, your investors, and your mom thought your story was great, awesome. If the movie was shot for 4 weeks, and went extremely well, even better. If you showed the final edit to the janitor and he went home and told his family about how some guy wasted his time at work, you don&#39;t even know you have a problem yet. Once you release it to the public, you will know. Even if you actively ignore feedback, you will feel your bank account not increasing. You will feel the trouble financing your next movie. You will have wasted everyone that saw the movie&#39;s time. You will have lost your investor&#39;s money. You will have wasted your own time.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been invited to a few screenings of movies before they are fully complete. Sometimes there is no music, or the edit is slightly rough. As I&#39;m watching, I cant help but notice some of the problem, most of which have nothing to do with the fact that the edit is rough, and that there is no music. The story is bad. It is a bad movie. No amount of editing could save it. In every case, everyone in the private audience talks about how great the movie is. Do they not know how bad it is? How did it get this far? Sure enough, the movie is not sold for distribution.</p>

<p>This is my greatest fear.</p>

<p>Coming from the perspective of a software developer, a game developer, and someone that has built companies, developing a movie with a standard approach seems like a gigantic step backwards.</p>

<p>I want a way to rapidly prototype my movie. The technical result of movie is more or less 90 minutes of sequential frames of images and some audio. If I could sketch images for key moments in the movie, in order, I could allow people to experience the movie. They should be able to experience the story. If they can&#39;t, it&#39;s not because I didn&#39;t draw well enough, it&#39;s because the story is not good.</p>

<p>What&#39;s great about that, is that I can use the feedback to make a better story. I can make modifications to the script. I can make modifications to the sketches. I can retest the new story. I can decide to completely change the story, if it needs a total reboot.</p>

<p>ask others
    writers hate this
    people that have worked in animation love it</p>

<p>requires new way of thinking
    collaboration</p>

<p>start developing tool</p>

<p>pixar</p>

<p>videos</p>

<p>my tool</p>

<p>idea for a new studio</p>

<hr>

<p>videogame development span vs film development span</p>

<p>depends on resources? every movie needs to do this!</p>

<p>mitigate risk</p>

<p>be able to show your story to other people</p>

<p>be able to see your story yourself</p>

<p>storyboards inform the story rather than just blocking it out after the fact</p>

<p>many writers do not like this</p>

<p>writing is likely a collaborative effort</p>

<p>ability to board very very fast</p>

<p>writer and director should board at the same time with an illustrator who could be the same person</p>

<p>stick figures are ok</p>

<p>well storyboarding is for animation</p>

<p>what is the difference between live action and animation in terms of story? nothing.</p>

<p>need fresh people for testing</p>

<p>story development
    many stories</p>

<p>financed through advertisers? is this a good idea? harder for distro</p>

<p>get production costs down</p>

<p>cant believe every movie is comped out</p>

<p>distribution</p>

<p>make pixar comparison</p>

<p>wes anderson</p>

<p>controlled group testing</p>

<p>Fresh people are worth their weight in gold</p>

<p>but sotryboards are 90% for you</p>

<p>this will work for spec writers too</p>

<p>Another key innovation occurred after a frustrated Pete Docter stopped by my office one day in 2002. What he really needed, he said, was the ability to splice together rough storyboards of a scene, time them out precisely, and then narrate over them in a Braintrust meeting, enabling him to convey the same enthusiasm and passion as he did in his initial live pitch and better approximating the desired end result: a film. I went to one of our software leaders, Michael Johnson, to see if he could put something together for Pete. Two weeks later, Michael came back with a prototype that would later become known as “Pitch Docter,” in homage to Pete. The basic problem Pitch Docter sought to solve is one I’ve mentioned before—that when a director first pitches a movie, he or she is basically acting it out like a piece of performance art. A pitch is dynamic. The director is able to look the audience in the eye, see how the various elements are playing, and adjust on the fly. This performance, though, is not the film, and when the story is put up on reels and forced to stand on its own, it frequently falls flat. Conventional pitching was good theater, in other words, but it didn’t begin to simulate a movie. Pitch Docter did that. Pitch Docter let artists seek criticism earlier, which is always better. It allowed those giving feedback to evaluate the material by simulating its presentation in film. Initially we didn’t know if the artists would accept this way of working—they had spent their careers working on paper, and if they were going to adopt this technology, they needed to discover and embrace it on their own. Soon, though, they saw its advantages. Since storyboards are frequently modified, having them on the computer simplified the process; the delivery of new versions to the team was as easy as a push of a button. As more artists adopted the tool, meanwhile, their requests for more features improved the tool itself. The software developers and the artists worked together to move the tools forward, and the model of how the artists did their work changed as the software evolved to meet their needs. This process was driven both by requests from artists and suggestions from programmers—a back and forth that came about because of the integration of technology and art. Michael’s team, known as the Moving Pictures Group, meanwhile, has become an example of the mindset we value—a mindset that doesn’t fear change. We apply this concept throughout the studio—software people rotate in and out of production. This way of doing things is responsive; it is nimble—and it makes us better.</p>

      Hi! My name is <a href="https://twitter.com/charlesforman" target="_new">Charles Forman</a>. I love to make stuff I dream up. A while back, I founded a videogame company called OMGPOP that developed Draw Something, that sold to Zynga. Remember that? No? It's ok. I also co-founded <a href="https://picturelife.com/" target="_new">Picturelife</a>, a great place to store and organize all your private photos. I am originally from Chicago, and I've lived in Tokyo, Seoul, and New York City. I am currently living in NYC and I'm working on developing a movie.
